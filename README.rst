Openstack Python Examples
=========================

Work in progress...

A collection of examples on how to use different python OpenStack clients to get your work done. This is *not* meant as a library, but rather something you can use to find examples to point you in the right direction.

This project also installs the most common command line clients so you can start playing around with OpenStack.

Installation
------------

git clone https://github.com/ZettaIO/openstack-python-examples

This project includes a `Vagrant` file to automatically set up things for you.
