Openstack Python Examples
=========================

Work in progress...

A collection of examples on how to use different python OpenStack clients to
get your work done. This is *not* meant as a library, but rather something
you can use to find examples to point you in the right direction.

This project also installs the most common command line clients so you can
start playing around with OpenStack.

Installation
------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZettaIO/openstack-python-examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that the current client package are pinned to lower version and
may need to be upgraded in the future.
