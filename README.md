# Openstack Python Examples

A collection of examples on how to use different python OpenStack clients to
get your work done. This is *not* meant as a library, but rather something
you can use to find examples to point you in the right direction.

This project also installs the most common command line clients so you can
start playing around with OpenStack.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZettaIO/openstack-python-examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that `requirements.txt` references the latest OpenStack
clients and you may assume any outdated python version will
not work. Python 3.6 or higher is most likely required.
